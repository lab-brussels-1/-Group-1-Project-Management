**Coding** is one of the most interesting things for programmers and software
developers. You started doing it for fun, it was your hobby, it was your passion
and later your passion becomes your job.

But today I want to tell about the symptoms of burnout and how to prevent it.

## The Triggers

### So Little Time So Much To Learn

Every time start to learn, everybody always takes a glimpse at how many chapters
left that has to go through. Slowly but sure, it started to stress out when you
see that there are still so many chapters to go after a while. Sometimes You
wish could have more than 24 hours in a day.

### The Grass Is Always Greener On The Other Side

With so many tutorials that you followed, I still feel like I know nothing and
stressing out about it.

### Comparing

**The only way to get out of it is to overcome.**

#### Take a break and enjoy the break time

Take a break regularly. There's a weekend anyway in a week that letting people
take a break between workdays.

#### Exercise and have enough rest

Doing exercise has been proven to help in overcoming stress.

#### Do the "Pomodoro Technique"

need to do in that interval without any distraction. And when the time is up,
get up and stay away from your working/study space for 5 minutes. Grab a drink
or do some stretching. After 4 sets of Pomodoro, take a 30 minutes break before
resetting the Pomodoro. In learning, it is better to learn in small chunks
rather than cramming the whole lesson. So this technique is good to be applied.

#### Hold yourself from lurking around other languages after you decided your path

The programming world is very dynamic and changing fast. There are plenty of
programming languages, frameworks, and libraries out there. Maybe you have
gotten your hands wet on some languages and then you decided on which one you
will go for. When you do, stick with your choice to avoid overwhelming that
finally leads to burnout.

_Stop comparing_ Every person's journey, every person's circumstances are
different and unique. So stop comparing yourself with others.
