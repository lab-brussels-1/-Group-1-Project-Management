# _Meet Fenny_

An island monkey who turns to civilization to learn how to `code` and
`adult-ing`. I've spent half of my life jumping from one island to the other
island then make a bigger leap from one continent to the other (hence island
monkey) :laughing:

_Career wise_, I'm an experienced Community of Happiness, Event, and Program
Coordinator with a demonstrated history of working in the tourism & hospitality
industry. Working with start ups allowed me to get surface-level experience in
most digital marketing channels, and has helped me find my interest in data
analysis, and web design.
